    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "Run the code cell below to plot a histogram of these two features. Note the range of the values present and how they are distributed."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Trees: \n",
    "\n",
    "Real world application : Customer service is a good example of real world application of decision trees. For example if a customer seeks help to resolve certain product issue the decision trees can guide them to the right resource, Example : Customer calling to resolve Bill payment issue, the decision tree can take them from 1. Is it a new customer y/n 2. if N then is your issue related to Bill payment Y/N 3. If Y then redirect the call to Payment department. So decision trees can be helpful in guiding the customer to the right department. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Decision Trees: \n",
    "\n",
    "a. Decision Trees implicitly perform variable selection : The top few nodes of the decision trees are essentially the most important variables within the dataset and make feature selection completely automated. \n",
    "    \n",
    "b. Decision Trees require little data preparation from the users, and missing variables dont impact the decision trees a lot. They are also not sensitive to outliers like linear regression models hence normalization doesn't have a large effect on them as well. \n",
    "    \n",
    "c. Decision Trees are also easy to interpret and explain to the non-technical or business leaders: Due to their intuitive nature the decision trees are easy to explain. As conditional splits of data is easily explained to everyone. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Decision Trees: \n",
    "   \n",
    "a. Descion Trees tend to overfit the training data if the hyperparameters like depth and minimum and Maximum number of splits are not carefully considered and this can make them poor predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees is good for our model as our model consists of categorical features hence splitting will be easy to implement and interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "===============================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines: \n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines are mainly used for classification problems and are very helpful in text classification particularly sentiment classification, this can be used to find out if a particular tweet was positive or negative and if we refine the solution further can be helpful in finding out if the tweet contained a hate message or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of SVMs: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. It works very well with clear margin of separations, helps identify distinct classes quite accurately. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. If there are multidimensional spaces it is very efficient in those cases as well. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   c. It is efficient even if the number of dimensions are greater than the number of samples \n",
    "   \n",
    "Disadvantages of SVMs: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. It doesn't perform well, in cases of large datasets because required training time is higher\n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. If the classes are overlapping, i.e. the data has noise the performance is compromised. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Since our classification problem cannot be linearly separable, modifying the kernel and other parameters can be helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "===============================================================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression : \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression predicts the probability of certain certain events hence these models can be very useful in prediciting the consumer behavior for example whether the people of the a certain area will vote democrat or republican. They are also very efficient in marketing models where we can predict whether a customer will buy a certain product or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Logistic Regression: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. Easy to interpret as it predicts the probability. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. It can be regularized to avoid overfitting. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   c. Works very well with Gradient descent algorithms for new data, so is very scalable\n",
    "    \n",
    "DisaAdvantages of Logistic Regression: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   a. Logistic regression tends to underperform when there are multiple or non-linear decision boundaries. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   b. Incapable of predicting continous outcomes like high-fever/low-fever. Has limited outcome capabilities \n",
    "   \n",
    "Since in our problem we need to predict whether the person is a donor or not hence calculating the probability of that will be interpretable and implementation will not require significant effort\n",

    "AdaBoost is an algorithm which creates a strong learner from combining the results of a few weak learners. Think of it as asking 5 of your friends to answer a multiple choice question and then later on combining ther results simply by voting or finding how many of your friends answered Yes or No to a particular question and then using that as your answer(Caution: Please do not do this on Udacity or other educational forums or platforms it is against the honor code, at work we refer to this as collaborating). \n",
    "\n",
    "Weak learners are simple models which predict the outcome slightly better than random guess. In our case we are using Random forest as a weak learner. The reason behind that is because without any additonal effort of parameter tuning we can acheive that behaviour, they are relatively fast to train and classify it would be helpful for us as we might need to iterate or repeat the process 100s to even 1000s of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by building a model from the training data, then another model(friend) comes along and corrects the mistakes of the previous model. This process is iterated till the everything is correctly predicted or the number of models limit decided has reached. Also one thing to remember for this model is that it assigns a penalty or punishment to incorrectly classified/predicted data points by assigning them a higher weight incomparison to others and they all start at standard equal weights. \n"

So out of 5 I could got 3 features correctly, however there importance is not what I expected. Visualization shows capital gain and capital loss are the two features that can definitely influence the donation since depending on the capital gain or loss in a given year can influence donating behavior.**"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
